# "My Contest App"


<!--
The "App Overview" section intends to be a high level description of your app. Think of what you might want to know if considering a purchase in an app store. 
-->

## App Overview

"My Contest App" enables students to control notifications related to their classes from their cell phone. This improves their awareness of assignments and due dates through customizable alerts. It is proven that today's students are more tech savvy than ever. They expect to interact with classes in the same way as their social networks. "My Contest App" makes courses more mobile and social by doing something remarkable...

<!--
The "App Details" section intends to explain how your app works. Describe the major components, what APIs were used, and what is missing to make this production ready.
-->

## App Details

"My Contest App" utilizes a 3rd party messaging system to keep classmates alerted of assignments. This was chosen over text messages and push notifications because of the great selection of emoji and meme support.

### API Usage

 * [3rd Party Messaging API](#) - provides communication services
 * [LearningStudio API](http://developer.pearson.com/learningstudio/course-apis/course-info/enrollment/reference) - provides class schedules and rosters
 * [LearningStudio Eventing](http://developer.pearson.com/learningstudio/receive-events) - provides realtime notifications of class happenings

### Scope of Functionality 

This application is mostly functional. The number of users able to use this application is limited by shortcuts taken for data storage. These were necessary to finish by the deadline, but replacing the temporary data store with a more scaleble solution would make this application ready for prime time!
